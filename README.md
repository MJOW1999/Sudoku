## Inspiration
I've been doing Sudokus for as long as I can remember. I've based this project off of the Sudoku book I've had for over 10 years and Sudoku.com.  

## Process
* Came up with the idea to make a Sudoku game and sought out a tutorial (_13/03/2021_).
* Completed the tutorial and added custom boards based on levels on Sudoku.com (_17/03/2021_). Below is part of the custom boards process.

* My personal level times:
  - EXPERT: 35 minutes, 2 mistakes
  - HARD: 16 minutes, 1 mistake
  - MEDIUM: 11 minutes, 0 mistakes
  - EASY: 5 minutes, 0 mistakes.
 
  Based off of these times, I made the timer levels 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes respectively. (_19/03/2021_)

* Added a few styling edits (light/dark mode and instructions with emoji bullet points) (_20/03/2021_)
* Uploaded project to GitHub (_21/03/2021_)
* Added README file to GitHub project (_27/04/2021_)

## Features
* Fully functional Sudoku game
* Stylish layout
* Multiple game difficulties

To-do list:
* Add more boards for each difficulty level
* Add a 3D button (_not necessary_)

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
